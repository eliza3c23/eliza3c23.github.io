        "review": "I would have preferred microwave dinner than spending money at this LO noodles n company. I got my sister to go Pad Thai for dinner. She had two bites and she said she couldn't finish the meal because it is gross. I tried a bit but I was done after the second bites of it. This is the worse Pad Thai I've ever experienced. The noodles were dry and rubbery, literally taste like plastic, sprouts inside are raw, and eggs are overcooked. Although the food is crapy, all the staffs are nice and friendly. Don't think I will go back unless none of the restaurant nearby open." ,
